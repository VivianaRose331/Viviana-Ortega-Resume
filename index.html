        <p class="lead mb-4">Education:Bachelors in Education studies and Minor in Psychology. I got my degree from UCR and graduated in the spring of 2022. Some of the internship opportunties I participated in were working in a mental health clinic and shadowing my high school councelor. I worked with the Mental Health Cilnic through Riverside County during the summer of 2021- fall of 2022. I shadowed my high school guidance councelor throughout fall of 2022 through spring of 2022.Throughout both of those experiences I got to gain knowledge on what I wanted to do in the future.Throughout both of those experiences, I got to gain knowledge on what I wanted to do in the future. Working at the Mental Health Clinic was a particularly unique experience. I got to work with therapists who were seeing patients. The majority of the time I would help organize files and portfolios. One of my favorite people to work with there was Luz Negron who was a supervisor at the Clinic. She always had insight and inspiration. view on life. She always sent me different internship opportunities
<br><br>

         Shadowing my high school counselor was a lot of fun. I was back at my high school where my dreams and aspirations began. Me. Martinez was a crucial part of my educational journey; he always encouraged me to go out there and see what life had to offer. Shadowing for him felt like going back home, I got to learn a lot of important skills such as how to communicate with students and help them feel more comfortable. How to give advice without negatively impacting those students' emotions. I also got to visit a lot of my old teachers during that time and help them in their classrooms. One of my favorites in particular was visiting my previous water polo coach and AP Psychology teacher Chris Ward. Throughout my educational career at UCR I also worked for some time at the UCR dining halls particularly Lothian. I worked there from the fall of 2020- the spring of 2021. It was a very insightful experience. I made a lot of connections and friendships. The hours were flexible and managers worked with oneâ€™s schedule.<br><br>

         After four years of Undergraduate, I have decided that I would also like to pursue a graduate degree, particularly in school psychology or Child development. Child development and School psychology are both closely related fields but before applying I wanted to look for a first job and then make that transition into graduate school. A few of the graduate programs I have been looking into are UC Irvine, UC San Diego, and UC Riverside. These schools all have programs Iâ€™m interested in and around areas I would consider establishing my life in for a decent period of time. I have also directly gone into a PHD program but I have decided that getting my masters is something I find more beneficial for me. As of right now I am looking for employment with any position involving working with children in a school setting.
